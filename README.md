# Implementations of classic Machine Learning algorithms

## Perceptron
Implementation of a single artificial neuron (aka perceptron) and experimentations around it.

## Kohonen
Also known as a self-organizing map, it's a kind of artificial neural network trained in a unsupervised way.
Kohonen is mostly used as a dimensionality reduction tool.
A visualisation lets you see the convergence through the epoques.

## Expectation-Maximisation
Implementation of a soft clustering tool in ML.
In addition with a visualisation tool for 1d and 2d inputs, so you can see kernels converging through the data points.
